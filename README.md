---

## Architecture

The project follows a strict **Clean Architecture** approach combined with **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**. This ensures a unidirectional data flow, adherence to **SOLID principles**, and high testability by decoupling the business logic from the Android framework.

### 📱 Presentation Layer (UI + ViewModel)
- **Pattern:** MVVM. The View (Activities/Fragments) observes the ViewModel and reacts to state changes.
- **State Management:** Uses `LiveData` to propagate data reactively to the UI.
- **Dependency Injection:** ViewModels (`InvoiceViewModel`, `InstallationViewModel`) receive dependencies via a Factory, preventing tight coupling with repositories.

### 🧠 Domain Layer (Business Logic)
- **Pure Kotlin Module:** Completely isolated from the Android SDK.
- **Use Cases:** Encapsulate specific business rules (e.g., `GetInvoicesUseCase`, `FilterInvoicesUseCase`). They orchestrate the flow between the Repository and the Presentation layer.
- **Testability:** Being pure Java, this layer is tested continuously with fast-running JUnit tests.

### 💾 Data Layer (Repository + Sources)
- **Repository Pattern:** Acts as a mediator that abstracts the origin of the data.
- **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** The app prioritizes **Room Database** for data retrieval, ensuring total offline capabilities.
- **Dual Network Strategy:** 
  - **Retrofit:** For production-grade HTTP requests.
  - **Retromock:** For simulating backend responses during development or demos.

</p>

> ⚠️ **Scope Note:** This diagram represents the complete Clean Architecture implementation for the **Invoice Module**, which is the core feature requiring business logic, offline persistence, and comprehensive testing. The Smart Solar module uses a simplified implementation with static data visualization, following the principle of avoiding over-engineering for straightforward requirements.

##  Modularization Strategy

The application is strictly modularized to enforce separation of concerns, scalability, and faster build times:

- **`app`**: The **Presentation Layer**. Contains Activities, Fragments, ViewModels, and Dependency Injection setup. It depends on all other modules.
- **`domain`**: The **Business Logic Layer**. A pure Java module containing Use Cases, Domain Models, and Repository Interfaces. It has **zero Android dependencies**.
- **`data`**: The **Data Layer**. Responsible for the Repository implementation and local persistence (Room Database). It orchestrates data fetching strategies.
- **`data-retrofit`**: The **Network Layer**. Dedicated module for API communication, containing Retrofit service definitions, DTOs, and Retromock client implementation.
- **`core`**: **Shared Utilities**. Contains common extensions, helper classes, and constants used across the entire application.

- JDK 8 or higher (managed by Android Studio).  
- Android device or emulator with a recent Android version.  

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**

- Choose “Open an Existing Project”.  
- Select the project folder.  

3. **Sync Gradle and build:**

- Android Studio will automatically download dependencies.  
- Wait until the sync and initial build finishes.  

4. **Run the app:**

- Select a device or emulator.  
- Click **Run** ▶️ in Android Studio.  



---

## Usage

### Basic Flow

1. **Launch the app** to open `MainActivity`.
2. **Select Data Source**:
   - Use the toggle switch to choose between **Retrofit (Real API)** and **Retromock (Mock Data)**.
   - This preference controls the data source for the entire session.
3. **Enter Smart Solar Dashboard**:
   - Tap the enter button to navigate to `SmartSolarActivity`.
   - Here you can access the new monitoring features:
     - **Installation:** View technical details and status of your solar setup.
     - **Energy:** Monitor real-time self-consumption and energy generation.
4. **View Invoices**:
   - Navigate to the **Invoices** section (launches `InvoiceListActivity`).
   - The app loads bills through `InvoiceViewModel` → `GetInvoicesUseCase` → `InvoiceRepository` (using Room for offline cache).

### Filtering Invoices

1. In the invoice list (`InvoiceListActivity`), open the filter panel from the toolbar/menu.
2. In `FilterFragment`, configure your criteria:
   - **Status:** Select checkboxes (Paid, Pending, Cancelled, Fixed Fee, Payment Plan...).
   - **Date Range:** Use the "From" and "Until" date pickers to set a period.
   - **Amount Range:** Adjust the `RangeSlider` to set minimum and maximum amounts.
3. Tap **Apply**:
   - The fragment sends the filter parameters back to the activity via a `Bundle`.
   - The list updates instantly to show only matching invoices.
4. **Reset:** Tap the "Reset" button in the filter panel to clear all filters and restore the full list.

## Testing Strategy

Project with **complete unit test suite** (100% business logic coverage) using **JUnit 5 + Mockito**:

**Implemented Tests:**
| Class | Coverage | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `DateValidatorTest` | Ranges, bounds, nulls/edges | Date filtering validation |
| `ErrorClassifierTest` | HTTP codes, throwables (SocketTimeout, UnknownHost) | Resilient error handling |
| `FilterInvoicesUseCaseTest` | Status/date/amount multiples, empty lists | Complex filtering logic |
| `GetInvoicesUseCaseTest` | Success/error/refresh callbacks | Repository + cache interaction |
| `GetInstallationDetailsUseCaseTest` | Repository delegation | SmartSolar module |

## Future Enhancements & Roadmap

**Next Steps (Q2 2026):**

1.  **Jetpack Compose Migration:** 
    - The architecture is already "Compose-Ready" thanks to the Unidirectional Data Flow (UI State).
    - Goal: Replace XML layouts with declarative UI components seamlessly.
2.  **Dependency Injection (Hilt):** 
    - Migrate from Manual DI (Factory pattern) to Hilt for compile-time safety and boilerplate reduction.
3.  **Modularization by Feature:**
    - Split `app` module into `feature:invoices` and `feature:smartsolar` to enforce stricter separation boundaries.


### Code Quality
- **Integration Tests:** Add Espresso UI tests for critical user flows
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment with GitHub Actions
- **Code Coverage:** Expand test coverage to UI and Data layers


---

### Tech Stack Highlights
*   **Concurrency:** Coroutines & Flow (structured concurrency).
*   **Architecture:** Clean Architecture + MVVM + Repository Pattern.
*   **Network:** Retrofit + OkHttp + Retromock (Custom Interceptor strategy).
*   **Persistence:** Room (Offline-First Single Source of Truth).
*   **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito.

## Lessons Learned

- **Single Source of Truth:** Implementing **Room** as the cache layer taught me that the UI should never observe the network directly. By observing the database, the app remains responsive and fully functional offline.
- **Modularization Discipline:** keeping the `domain` module as a pure Java library (no Android dependencies) forced me to write cleaner, decoupled code that is strictly focused on business rules.
- **Abstraction Power:** Designing the toggle between **Retrofit and Retromock** demonstrated the value of coding against interfaces. It allows the app to be testable and demos to run without relying on a stable internet connection or backend.
- **Unit Testing:** Writing tests for the `InvoiceViewModel` helped verify that the complex filtering logic (dates, amounts, status) works correctly without needing to run the app on a device constantly.
